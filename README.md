# Portfolio-Optimizer
This project has three files: two of them are python and one of them is excel. The way it works is you run the python script "Portfolio Builder.py" This generates a stock_data comma seperate value file. Then you run the portfolio builder vba file! It creates a minimum variance portfolio and tangency portfolio of the stocks you specified in Portfolio Builder.py! Make sure that you use a vba enabled spreadsheet and solver works with your vba. Also you will need to specify the ws1 variable for the spreadsheet you are applying the macro to.
